# dummyfile

hey dummy! want to create a large dummyfile for testing? you can use this!

install with: `cargo install --git https://github.com/ingobeans/dummyfile.git`

then do like `dummyfile 8mb`

it is made in rust but that doesn't mean it is fast, theres surely a more efficient way to generate these files but for me this works fine.
